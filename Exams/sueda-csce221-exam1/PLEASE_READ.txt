There are a couple things that should be discussed, but the most important thing is make commands.

Commands for running locally:
 make -C tests run-all           - Run all tests (stops when a test fails)
 make -C tests run-all -k        - Run all tests (runs all tests, even if some fail)
 make -C tests run/<test_name>   - Run a specific test_name
    * Replace <test_name> with the name of the test case in the tests/tests folder
      without the .cpp

Pointer class:
    You may notice the Pointer class in the starter code. It is just a way that we can check how you
    are using the pointers and how you are navigating the array. It works the same as a pointer. For 
    example, Pointer<int> is the same thing as int*, and Pointer<double> is the same as double*. You 
    can perform the exact same operations you would on a pointer using the Pointer object.

Basically, ignore the weird looking type names. They work the same as normal C++, so use them in the
same way.
